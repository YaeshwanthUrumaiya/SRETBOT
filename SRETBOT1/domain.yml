  utter_explain_ask_about_profs:
  - text: click here sret.edu.in/Faculty.html; Personal opinion -> The teaching is pretty good. They start from the basics in the first year and slowly build on that foundation you gained in that first year. They give you time and guidance for you to build your projects during internship. As a matter of fact, I was built by a first year student in his internship period. It is surely worth the trouble of studying discrete mathematics for 3 years to come.
