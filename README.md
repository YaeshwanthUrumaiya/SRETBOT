# SRETBOT: An intent based chatbot built for College Website (Year-1 Internship)

## Introduction:
Why did I work on such a project? Since students who wish to join the college tend to have questions. They mostly likely contact the staff, who has the tedious job of repeating more or less the same answers; or the students might use the internet to find answers, but not every answer is available out there on the world wide web. So, I decided to create a Web Widget ChatBot using RASA's Framework which could help these students.

## Workings:
Create an anaconda environment and open the ```index.html``` file in your browser and run the following commands
```
pip install rasa
rasa run actions
rasa run --enable-api --cors="*" --port 5005
```

## Result: 
When I first took up on this project I was lacking in Knowledge about Machine learning. With the help of my professors, I was able to get a head start and learn the basics of Machine learning as a whole and I also learnt the basics of NLP and how language models work. Along with that, I also learnt the basics of Website design and animation (Krita) 

The Presentation and the final Report of the Internship is attached as well!
